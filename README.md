# OFPS server client system
---
This project will go private once the server/client implementation is finished and documented. Aims to create an off thread networking implementation that mimics ealry call of duty p2p server/client system that yields flexibility to other hosting systems like a dedicated server cloud distrobution - (later)


overall this frees developers from being at the mercy of unity's networking implementation as it is ever changing and restricts alot.
